# How to run?
First, you need to run the API locally. For how, refer to [README on repository for the API](https://github.com/room23studios/zsa-quotes-api/).

After successfully setting up the API, you need to run HTTP server in the repository directory. Be aware though, that API runs on port 8000, so you might need to select a different port.
```
$ python -m http.server 8080
```
